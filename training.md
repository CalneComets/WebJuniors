Training takes place during winter at [Calne Leisure Centre](http://www.calneleisure.co.uk/) on a Friday evening between 7PM and 8PM. During summer there is no formal training but there is often a game somewhere on a Friday evening if the weather is good.

The cost is Â£3 per training session for each junior.
