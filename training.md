Training takes place during winter at [Calne Leisure Centre](http://www.calneleisure.co.uk/) on a Friday evening between 7PM and 8PM. During summer there is no formal training but there is often a game somewhere on a Friday evening if the weather is good.

The cost is Â£3 per training session for each junior.

The parents (or guardians) of each player are asked to fill out one of our [contact forms](http://calnecomets.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Junior-Contact-Information-2014.pdf) each season in order that we know how to get in touch about any events or if something unexpected happens.
