Training takes place during winter at [Calne Leisure Centre](http://www.wiltshire.gov.uk/leisure-calne) on a Friday evening between 6PM and 7PM.

The cost is Â£3 per training session for each junior.

Players should bring water to drink and hand sanitizer.

The parents (or guardians) of each player are asked to fill out one of our [contact forms](https://calnecomets.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Junior-Contact-Information-2019.pdf) each season in order that we know how to get in touch about any events or if something unexpected happens.
