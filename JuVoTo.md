The [SWVA](https://www.swva.org.uk/) organises a series of junior volleyball tournaments (known as JuVoTo) each season. Teams can compete in any number of the tournaments and are awarded points for their finishing position in their category. The points from each tournament are added up to determine the overall winners for the season. Each tournament is hosted by a different club.
There are [more details](https://www.swva.org.uk/junior-grand-prix) and [dates](https://www.swva.org.uk/calendar) on the SWVA website.
