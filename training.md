Training takes place during winter at [Calne Leisure Centre](http://www.wiltshire.gov.uk/leisure-calne) on a Friday evening between 7PM and 8PM.

The cost is Â£3 per training session for each junior.

Due to the current Coronavirus restrictions the juniors are training on a Friday evening at the Calne Recreation Ground (off Anchor Road) starting at 18:30. Please note that the session can be called off at short notice due to weather conditions. It is necessary to book for the sessions in advance.

The parents (or guardians) of each player are asked to fill out one of our [contact forms](https://calnecomets.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Junior-Contact-Information-2019.pdf) each season in order that we know how to get in touch about any events or if something unexpected happens.
