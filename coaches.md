The volleyball club is fortunate to have a number of coaches. All of our coaches are qualified to at least level 1 and Volleyball England has carried out a [DBS check](https://www.volleyballengland.org/about_us/safeguarding/dbs_checking) on each coach. Those responsible for coaching the juniors are:

* Cliff Ball (UKCC1)
* Neil Bentley (UKCC1)
* Jenny Boorman (UKCC1)
